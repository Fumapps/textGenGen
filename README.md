# textGenGen

MPS plugin for generating textGen definitions derived from editor definitions, so that the text generated by textGen is the same as the one rendered on the screen by the editor.

## User manual
To install the plugin, open MPS and go to **File** > **Settings** > **Plugins** > **Install plugin from disk...** and locate the zip archive.
After restart, two options should appear in the context menu after right clicking on any module:
1. Save as text - Exports textual representation of all nodes in a module as they are rendered on the screen.
2. Generate textGen - Generates textGen definitions from editor definitions

## Building and development
The *Build solution* enables creation of installable package (a zip archive that can be permanently installed into MPS). The *mps_home* in section *macros* variable needs to be changed to point to your MPS installation home. You will also need JDK (optimally 1.8).
